# Using Neurobiological Frameworks for Anomaly Detection in System Log Streams

My Master's thesis in Signal Processing at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

Development was done in Python together with NuPIC, pandas, and the GloVe algorithm among others.

## Abstract 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown enormous potential, and is predicted to be a prosperous field that will likely revolutionise entire industries and bring forth a new industrial era. However, most of today's AI is either, as in deep learning, an oversimplified abstraction of how an actual mammalian brains neural network function, or methods sprung from mathematics. But, with the foundation of the bold ideas of Vernon Mountcastle stated in 1978 about the neocortical functionality, new frameworks for creating true machine intelligence have been developed, and continues to be. 
  
 In this thesis, we study one such theory, called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We use this framework to build a machine learning model in order to solve the task of detecting and classifying anomalies in system logs belonging to Ericsson's component based architecture applications. The results are then compared to an existing classifier, called Linnaeus, which uses classical machine learning methods. The HTM model is able to show promising capabilities of classifying system log sequences with similar results compared with the Linnaeus model. The HTM model is an appealing alternative, due to the limited need of computational resources and the algorithms ability to effectively learn with ``one-shot learning''.
