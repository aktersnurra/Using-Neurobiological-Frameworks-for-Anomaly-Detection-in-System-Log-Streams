\chapter{Method}
\label{chp_method}
In this chapter we combine the previous chapters of natural language processing with \textit{Hierarchical Temporal Memory} (HTM) to create an HTM model that is able to classify system logs. First, we explain the preprocessing step of the system logs. After this step, we convert the system logs into \textit{Sparse Distributed Representations} (SDRs) via the encoding process described in \autoref{sec:SDRencode}. Finally, we define the architecture of the HTM network and how it is trained and tested.
